{"artist":"Lee Harding","name":"Try Tonight","lyrics":"It's twelve o'clock\nAnd I haven't had my coffee yet\nI know she's here\nAcross the hallway, with a face I can't forget\nShe moved in\nAbout a month ago, I passed her on the stairs\nThe kinda girl\nThat you can look at and you know that she don't care\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm gonna try tonight\nI'm gonna pick myself right off the floor\nI'm gonna try tonight\nI don't know what to say but that's ok\n\nIt's three o'clock\nI'm watching reruns and I hear the sound of her voice\nI'd give it all\nTo ignore her but I haven't got a choice\nI'm gonna take a chance cos I've got nothing to lose\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWalkin down the hall, you know you're gonna take a fall\nThe door's so far from here, she's gonna disappear\nI might have left without a trace\nAnd there's a smile on her face\nBut I'm only dreamin (dreamin)\n\nFour o'clock\nIn the morning for the hundredth millionth time\nI'm still alone\nI'm going crazy cos she's still on my mind\nYeah she's still on my mind\nYeah she's still on my mind\n\nI'm gonna try tonight\nI don't know why tonight but I'm sure\n\n[Chorus]","url":"https:\/\/www.azlyrics.com\/lyrics\/leeharding\/trytonight.html"}
