{"artist":"Lee Harding","name":"Change The World","lyrics":"Do you know all the things I've been through\nDo you see what I have seen\nI can't stop the world, but I can stop my actions\nIt seems I just can't stop my head\nI'm too tired to think, too tired to breathe, too tired for anything at all\nI just want a break, I just want to take a year off from everything\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't change the world without you\nAnd I can't change the world alone\nI can't change my life without you\nSo I can't change my life alone\n\nDo you know all the things I've been through\nDo you feel what I feel\nI can't trust the world, but I can trust my actions\nIt seems I just can't trust my head\nI'm too tired to think, too tired to breathe, too tired for anything at all\nI just want a break, I just wanna take a year off from everything\nAnd I feel like I'm wastin all my time\nAnd I feel like I've left my life behind\nAnd I don't think I can take much more of this\nWhen I'm living my life clenched up like a fist\n\n[Chorus]\n\nDo you know all the things I've been through\nWill you see what I've seen\nI can't stop the world, but I can stop my actions\nIt seems I just can't stop my head\n\n[Chorus]","url":"https:\/\/www.azlyrics.com\/lyrics\/leeharding\/changetheworld.html"}
