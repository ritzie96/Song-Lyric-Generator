{"artist":"Lee Harding","name":"Just Another Love Song","lyrics":"I've seranaded you a billion times\nBut you don't hear the tune\nI'm singing tonight\nI guess I must have wrote\nA zillion lines\nJust to make you see\nWhat's staring you blind\nBut what do I know\nWhat can I do\nBut write another love song for you\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you would sing to me\nI'd feel the melody\nWon't be just another love song\nIf you could play the rest\nWe'd share a sweet caress\nDon't want just another love song\n\nThe angels all make\nA heavenly sound\nBut I know if you sang\nThey'd see what I've found\nYou never seem to guess\nWhat I'm trying to say\nWell your my diva\nYou belong on my stage\nBut what do I know\nWhat can I do\nBut write another love song for you\n\n[Chorus]\n\nAnd I can't love you anymore\nMore than this\nCos this is the maximum for sure\nYes it is!\n\n[Chorus]\n\nAnd I can't love you anymore\nMore than this\nCos this is the maximum for sure\nYes it is!\n\n[Chorus]","url":"https:\/\/www.azlyrics.com\/lyrics\/leeharding\/justanotherlovesong.html"}
