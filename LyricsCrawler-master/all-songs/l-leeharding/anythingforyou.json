{"artist":"Lee Harding","name":"Anything For You","lyrics":"Well I can't deny it\nDon't wanna let go\nJust wanna ride\nHigh on ya love so\nI got all the vibes that I need\nFills me up from my head to my feet\nWell I can't describe it\nSo I put on a show\nAnd then I act a little crazy when I'm feeling ya flow\nLike dynamite you're a real go getter\nI'm hypnotised, couldn't get much better\n\nBouncing on the town here we go\nBouncing up and down on a roll\nTurn on the lights\nSee my delights\nBaby look at me here I go\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI feel like jumping in the river\nTaking all my clothes off\nSwim butt naked\nTill I get arrested\nI'll do most anything for you\nCause I like your dirty attitude\nDancing on hot coals\nJuggling with chainsaws\nSleeping on a nail bed\nAll this and more\nI'll do most anything for you\nYes anything for you\n\nWell now I'm in trouble\nCaught by the cops\nFor the love that I showed you out on the rocks\nBut that don't mean a thing to me\nCos when you're near me I'm feeling free\nSo give me the smile\nThat makes me go wild\nGive me the look that got me so hooked\nSo tie me down before I explode\nYou're the best of all the feathers I ever did know\n\nBouncing on the town here we go\nBouncing up and down on a roll\nTurn on the lights\nSee my delights\nBaby look at me here I go\n\n[Chorus]","url":"https:\/\/www.azlyrics.com\/lyrics\/leeharding\/anythingforyou.html"}
